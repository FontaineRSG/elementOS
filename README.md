# 🌊 Fontaine Research Group Presents: **elementOS**  
*A Linux-based OS that "just works" — crafted by bored programmers who hate bloat.*  

## 🚀 What is elementOS?  
**elementOS** is a lightweight, user-friendly operating system built on the Linux kernel. We’re here to cut the nonsense and deliver software that’s **fast**, **intuitive**, and *actually fun to use*. Think of it as the "Hydro Archon" of OSes — fluid, efficient, and refreshing. 💧  


## ⚠️ Disclaimer  
**We are NOT affiliated with HoYoverse, Genshin Impact, or its universe.**  
While we’re inspired by the creativity of Teyvat (and Fontaine’s elegance!), this project is **100% unofficial**, non-commercial, and open-source. No Mora was harmed in the making.

## ✨ Features  
- 🚀 **Performance First**: Optimized for speed — no unnecessary background processes.  
- 🧩 **Modular Design**: Install only what you need. Batteries included, but removable.  
- 🔓 **Open Source Freedom**: Hackable, transparent, and community-driven.

# Coming eventually™
